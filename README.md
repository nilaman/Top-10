Project#2 Favorite Top Ten Website

Created a multi-page website that is about the top 10 streaming services and top 10 best workouts. There is a main page, an about page for each top 10, and Youtube reviews for the related content for each top 10. Includes use of bootstrap and embedding. 

Peer review Mason: The site functions with extra features like the on hover animations it looks good only thing is the UI can be cleaned up making things more visibly cleaner other than that its great.
